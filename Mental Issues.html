                    Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, is one of the very big social challenges that so many people struggle with.
                    "According to World Health Organization(WHO), mental disorders affect one in four people globally at some point in their lives".
                    Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions- disorders that affect a person's mood, thinking, and behaviour.
                    Examples of this illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addictive behaviours.
                    Many people have mental health concerns but these concerns changes into illness when ongoing symptoms and signs keep causing frequent stress and affect the ability to function.
                    There are mainly two leading causes of bad mental heath:
                <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Genetics,</li>
                        <li>Environment</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <figcaption>&copy; A painting about the thoughts of a person suffering with mental issues</figcaption>

                <p>
                    Environment is the reason that why mental issues are considered or being called as a social challenge or a social issue because,
                    it can affect a person's relationships with their friends, or family, or relatives, or co-workers.                        This increases burden on the society, surroundings, or economy. This further leads to less productivity, financial strain, increased absenteeism, emotional distress, extra burden, etc.
                    A lot of people suffer with mental issues, i.e. there is a lot of suffering, but less people are getting it's treatment, or are aware about that mental illness has treatments.
                    People are now aware about a few mental disorders but are not completely aware about the consequences and it's symptoms which makes it more difficult for people to accept if they are going through something mentally.

                    There are many drugs that can end a depressive episode. Then we have therapies, mostly implying Cognitive Behavioural Therapy(CBT), or Psychotherapy (also called talk therapy).
                    Other therapies are: electroconvulsive therapy, interpersonal therapy.
                    If a person who is suffering from any mental health disorder, they can also join support groups that help them to talk about their problems.
                    There are different medications such as antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, antipsychotic medications helps people to control their mental health (advised to purchase if a psychiatrist prescribes to buy).
